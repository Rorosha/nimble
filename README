Overview
========

The basis of this app is to have a blank canvas (the main page), that the
users can place planning cards onto and brainstorm for Agile development. 

JS will cover most of the heavy lifting for the AJAX side of things.
Depending on how the server handles the load initially, we might have
to steal some code from Etherpad for the collaboration piece.

Main Functions
==============

On initial load, the user will be presented with a login window. After 
inital login or registration the user will be automatically forwarded 
to the board. 

The board will have a button to create a card. This will show a card 
over top of the board with two editable fields, the summary and the 
user story. At the bottom of the card, there will be three buttons 'Save',
'Cancel' and 'Flip'. Once card has been flipped a user can update the 
acceptance criteria.

Once a card has been placed on the board, the user can then click and 
drag the card to anywhere on the board. Cards should be able to be 
stacked and organized into piles (probably needs some custom 
functionality for that). 

Multiple users should be able to create and edit cards at the same time.
Have to figure out how to handle conflicts upon edit.

Cards will be stored in a SQLite database. Eventually we would want this 
mapped to some form of DCVS (git or mercurial).

Estimates should be collaborative. Not sure if this needs to be a js 
function or a backend function, but having everyone on the board vote
for a story point estimate would make the process easy.

	Because of this, there probably needs to be some form of notification
	function for users that are logged in that someone else is viewing 
	and editing the card.

Multiple boards for different projects. Cards should be distinct to a 
board, but you should be able to migrate them to a new board.

Potential Additions
===================

Should interface with Jira, TFS and whatnot. This could be a useful 
interface for planning sessions - especially if it created the right
tickets in whatever system they used. This would probably have to be a 
separate application (though we could call it through the app once it 
was working).

Some form of tracking cards as they're completed would be nice (supposing
people wanted to use the app for that). But that's very much out of scope
at this point.

OAuth login for in-promptu planning sessions. Be able to create a new board
with a secret key to pass around and route people to the correct board. Then
the server could be a public facing application for use at conferences and 
classes on the Agile method.
